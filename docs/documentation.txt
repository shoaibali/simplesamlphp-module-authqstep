This is a 2-step verification authentication module. This requries a MySQL database to be created. 
Questions and answers database tables are automatically created if they don't exist. 

 * Configure it by adding an entry to config/authsources.php such as this:
 *
 *      'authqstep' => array(
 *       	'authqstep:authqstep',
 *
 *        	'db.dsn' => 'mysql:host=db.example.com;port=3306;dbname=idpauthqstep',
 *       	'db.username' => 'simplesaml',
 *       	'db.password' => 'password',
 *          'db.answers_salt' => 'secretsalt',
 *			'mainAuthSource' => 'ldap',
 *			'uidField' => 'uid'
 *        ),

 Once user provides their ldap credentials, if they have pre-existing answers registered in the database
 they are randomly asked one of their chosen question.

 If the user is new, they go through the process of chosing their questions and their respective answers.
 In order to complete the login user must provide a correct answer to its question. 

 All answers are normalized to lowercase to accomodate future hashing capability.
